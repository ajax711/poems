love will tear us apart again 



on a random tuesday evening
when the days settle in 
when i have accepted (the loss)
when the routine hits hard and had to carry on with work 

what is it now?
a taste of desperation, the yearning and the pain 
cheesecakes, shawarma and the smile you would feign 

love, love has tore us apart again 

maybe I was too young to hold love tight,
sometimes a man gets lost in his own mind,
caught in the whirl of endless whats ifs and doubts,
overthinking every word, until love burned out.

but we are our separate ways now, i dont wish you the best
because i still wait for that day in vain 

when love can tear us apart again.
