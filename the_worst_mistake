prompt : ---- the worst mistake ----

The worst mistake is not choosing a wrong career,
Not the test that you didnt prepare for and failed,
not the girl you didnt ask out, 
Not the cracks in plans, nor the slips of grace, 
Not even the shame that time can't erase.

It's the quiet click, i personally fear, 
The vanishing trace of all you held dear.

"Delete files", yes why not, put it in the trash
and now 3 years of your WhatsApp history, gone in a flash,

for now theres no pain to ponder over
its all a clean sheet
texts all sober (no drunk texts, gettit)

No bittersweet sting of a wound once raw,
No reliving the memories with the girl you saw,
Just a blank, empty space where memory withdraws.

For with every mistake, you learn and you heal,
But delete the memories, no solace you can find
A ghost of a story, erased from your mind.
